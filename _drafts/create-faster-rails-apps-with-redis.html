<p>How long are you willing to wait for a website to load? I know that's contingent on what you're waiting on but imagine it's Amazon. According to an <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-37100091">article</a> published last year on BBC half of us are only willing to wait 3 seconds for a shopping website to load. What does that mean for websites we build that aren't established and are trying to gain traction? I'd venture to say most people won't even wait 3 seconds so that begs the question of how do we make faster websites? The simple answer is caching but I'm going to show you how to use the in-memory data store Redis as a solution.</p>
<p>What is Redis? The first place you can find info is their website <a href="https://redis.io/">redis.io</a>, but for our purposes, it's a caching store. If you go to the website and feel overwhelmed that's exactly what happened to me. The possibilities are vast but we'll keep it simple for this post.</p>
<h2>What you'll need to Begin</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ruby 2.4.0 +</li>
<li>Rails 5.1.0 +</li>
<li>homebrew</li>
<li>Lenix (I'll be using macOS)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installing Redis</h2>
<p>Using homebrew it's extremely easy to add Redis. Just type the following into the terminal.</p>
<pre class="theme:terminal lang:sh decode:true " title="Redis Installation">brew install redis
redis-server</pre>
<p>That should start up the Redis server in your terminal and you'll see this hopefully.</p>

<p>That's all for installing redis. Next, we'll integrate it into a project.</p>
<h2>Using Redis</h2>
<p>Adding Redis to a project starts with adding the right gems. Open up your gemfile and add the following code.</p>
