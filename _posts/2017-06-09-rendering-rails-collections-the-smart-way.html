<p>This week I was working on a Rails application and stumbled across a really cool trick for rendering collections. As per the usual, it involves a little Rails magic as you'll see. This trick will clean up a lot of your views and adheres to our coveted DRY convention.</p>
<p>Imagine you're working on an application and you've got a collection of users you'd like to display. You might so something similar to this (Rails generated this when I used the <em>generate scaffold</em> command) to display all of your users.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.joshqn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1_Screen_Shot_09-06-17.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-490" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/1_Screen_Shot_09-06-17-1024x621.png" alt="" width="1024" height="621" /></a></p>
<p>This will work but I believe we can do better. To clean up the code we'll create a partial and then simply render it. This is where the magic happens.</p>
<h2>Creating Your Partial</h2>
<p>To create the magic we need to keep in mind a few things when we create the partial.</p>
<ol>
<li>The collection you pass to the view (@users, @todoItems, @etc) will determine what you need to name your partial.</li>
<li>Your partial needs to be the singular version of the collection. Rails will look for that name specifically. Pretty smart eh?</li>
</ol>
<p>Okay, with those things in mind we can create the partial. Since my collection is <strong>@users </strong>I'll give my partial the name <strong>_user.html.erb</strong>. Once inside the partial, I'll have access to the instance variable <strong>user</strong> and I can access its variables from there.</p>
<pre class="lang:ruby decode:true " title="app/views/users/_user.html.erb">&lt;li id="user-#{user.id}"&gt;
  &lt;span class="name"&gt;&lt;%= user.name %&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="bio"&gt;&lt;%= user.bio %&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;</pre>
<p>I used a list item because I plan to render my users inside of an ordered list. You can also see I used an id which will be unique and that'll make it easier to manipulate later with JavaScript. Lastly, I'll be styling the list so I added name and bio classes.</p>
<h2>Rendering the Partial</h2>
<p>This is the easiest part. Delete or comment the previous code you were using to render your collection and add the following.</p>
<pre class="lang:ruby decode:true " title="app/view/users/index.html.erb">&lt;ol class="users"&gt;
  &lt;%= render @users %&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</pre>
<p>A lot less code huh? It's a little bit of Rail's voodoo I admit but doesn't that look nicer?  You can even use this method for heterogeneous collections but I won't be covering that today. After adding that code and a little styling my view looks like this.</p>

<h4>Resources</h4>
<p>I stumbled onto this little gem via a Rails tutorial written by Michael Hartl <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/book/user_microposts">here</a> so go check that out. You can also find more documentation on the Rails guides <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html#using-partials">here</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks again! Auf wiedersehen!</p>
